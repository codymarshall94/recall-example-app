# ðŸ—£ Google Meet Transcript App

This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app that uses [Recall.ai](https://recall.ai) to transcribe a **Google Meet meeting** in real time using **meeting captions**.

No webhooks, no complex setup â€” just enter your API key, paste a meeting link, and watch the transcript appear.

---

##  Features

-  Transcribes **Google Meet** meetings via Recall.ai
- Includes **speaker names**
- Updates transcript in **real time** (polling every 3 seconds)

---

##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codymarshall94/recall-example-app.git
cd recall-example-app
```

---

### 2. Get Your Recall API Key

- Go to [https://dashboard.recall.ai](https://dashboard.recall.ai)
- Sign up or log in
- Copy your API key from the dashboard

---

### 3. Configure Your Environment

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and update with your own credentials:

```env
RECALL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
RECALL_REGION=us-east-1
```

> `RECALL_REGION` is required. If you're unsure, you can find it in your Recall dashboard near your workspaces.

---

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

##  How It Works

1. You paste a **Google Meet URL** into the input field.
2. Clicking **Start Transcription** calls the `/api/start-bot` API route.
3. This route:
   - Sends a `POST` request to `https://${RECALL_REGION}.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/`
   - Includes your `meeting_url` and required `recording_config.transcript.provider.meeting_captions`
   - Authorizes the request with: `Token ${RECALL_API_KEY}`  
     (âš  Must be prefixed with the word `"Token"`)
4. The Recall bot joins the meeting and begins capturing captions.
5. The frontend uses `setInterval` to poll the `/api/get-transcript` endpoint every 3 seconds.
6. The transcript (with speaker names + text) appears **in real time** in the UI.
